## TO DO

- Implement preprocessing function. Bikatr7/Kudasai/Kairyou can be refactored and incorporated. (Beware of Spacy dependency on Pydantic 1)
- Implement clause by clause analysis - Clause class, splitting function
- Implement DeepL TL via API
- Update HTML source and generator functions for translations and associated functionality and layout
- Refactor to improve readability and organization
- Better API handling
- Option to have raw APIs for google TL
- Webscraping is presently super slow. Needs optimization or replacement with a function equivalent to Jisho Sentence Parsing
